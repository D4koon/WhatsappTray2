# FAQ

## Why WhatsappTray2 instead of WhatsappTray(1)?

WhatsappTray had a lot of rough edges due to the fact that it basically hacks the Original Whatsapp-application.
WhatsappTray2 does not have this problem because there is no need to do this and therefore we can have full control over the application.

## So whats the difference between WhatsappTray2 and WhatsappTray(1)?

WhatsappTray2 uses Cefsharp and the website https://web.whatsapp.com
WhatsappTray uses the desktop-client of Whatsapp
